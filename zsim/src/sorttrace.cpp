/* Simple program to sort a trace. It reads in the trace sequntially until it
 * has seen at least one access from every thread, then dumps the sorted trace
 * out. This may consume large amounts of memory if traces are largely
 * imbalanced. A simple way to fix this would be to dump N separate traces,
 * then join them together --- that's more I/O though.
